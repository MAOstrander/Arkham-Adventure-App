More disturbingly, she has begun to dream of the vast green depths of the ocean and terrible alien cities that lie in its darkest crevasses. This evening, as she finishes her shift as a bank teller at the First Bank of Arkham, something out in the night calls to her - something dark and sinister that leaves the feel of sea foam in her mind and makes her gasp with the effort of resisting it. Leaning against the brick wall of the bank, Amanda realizes that she has to find out what's happening to her or she's going to fall prey to whatever aliend presence is invading her mind.",

After graduating from high school, he went to work for the Arkham Advertiser as a photographer, and in the years since, he's crawled over every square inch of the city. Last night, however, Darrell saw something horrible-- something that has shaken his world to its core and torn away the safe illusions we all foster to protect our minds and our souls. His editor says he was just seeing things, but as he leaves the newspaper building, he knows just what he saw and he intends to show the world! This time he'll be more careful. This time he'll take pictures and prove that things are not normal in Arkham.",

Intrigued by this ancient piece of occult knowledge, Dexter began to use his wealth in search of the truth about the ancient lore, and what he found horrified him. Now, the more he learns, the less he wants to know, but his studies have led him to believe that a great evil will soon arise in Arkham. He knows that he may well be the only person with the ability to stop this evil from swallowing the world, so he has come to that sleepy town to speak with the proprietor of Ye Olde Magick Shoppe, one of the few magic shops that contain true lore, and not merely the stage tricks he once studied.",

Since then, she has worked with many of the University professors, delving into esoteric tomes filled with scientific information, historical reports, and sometimes even occult ramblings. It was while reading an old book of prophecies last week that she first felt that she had stumbled onto something big. Mandy came to believe that certain signs and portents described in the book were taking place in Arkham right now-- omens that indicated the return of a terrible being reffered to as an Ancient One, which would grind the cities of Man beneath its loathsome tread. Tonight, the full moon has turned blood red, which is the final omen of the return of the Ancient One. Slipping into the night, and armed with her knowledge of the prophecy, Mandy has decided to see if she can defy fate and stop these events from taking place.",

For just an instant, there was a flash of a silver pendant with a symbol on it Monterey would never forget. That symbol had been carved into his murdered father's forehead, and had haunted his dreams for years. Chasing after the mysterious figure, he turned a corner only to discover that he had lost his quarry. However, Monterey knows that somewhere in Arkham may lie the answer to the mystery of his father's murder, and he's not leaving until he finds it.",
