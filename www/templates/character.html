        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
        <p>Amanda has been a student at Miskatonic University for 2 years now.
        On her way to talk to one of her professors last month, she saw a painting
        in the hallway that captured her attention with its hazy depiction of some
        horrible creature rising up out of the ocean. Ever since, Amanda has heard
        strange whispers in a foreign language whenever her attention drifts. More
        disturbingly, she has begun to dream of the vast green depths of the ocean
        and terrible alien cities that lie in its darkest crevasses.</p>
        <p>This evening, as she finishes her shift as a bank teller at the First Bank
        of Arkham, something out of the night calls to her-- something dark and sinister
        that leaves the feel of sea foam in her mind and makes her gasp with the effort
        of resisting it. Leaning against the brick wall of the bank, Amanda realizes that
        she has to find out what's happening to her or she's going to fall prey to whatever
        alien presence is invading her mind.</p>
